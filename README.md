## Neurolabs Technical Assessment
This project contains my solution for the Neurolabs Implementation Engineer take-home task. The script interacts with the Neurolabs Image Recognition API, runs inference on two sets of images (Cooler and Ambient), saves the raw results, visualises detections for cooler images, and generates a couple of basic analysis charts based on the detected products.

I’ve tried to keep the setup minimal and the workflow straightforward so it can be run end-to-end without any extra configuration.
